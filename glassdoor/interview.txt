Convert a tree to a doubly linked list.   

Architect a cloud-based queuing service   

Print a linked list in reverse recursively and non-destructively.  
public void print(Node node){
	if(node==null){
		return;
	}
	print(node.next);
	System.out.println(node.val);
}

Given a set of strings, return the smallest subset that contains prefixes for every string. If the list is ['foo', 'foog', 'food', 'asdf'] return ['foo', 'asdf']   

You have two words and would like to find the "minimum edit distance" between them. Edit distance is defined as the number of operations with: adding a letter, subtracting a letter, and replacing a letter. Make a function that finds the minimum edit distance.  

Bread-First Search on a Dictionary.   

Standard rotated binary search question. You have a sorted array that has been shifted/cycled, perform a search on it   

Design a product to help people find apartments - Investigate a Metric anomaly   

Question is verbose, uses search engine, string matching etc., but at the end boils down to this: There is two dimensional array where each sub array (row) is sorted, i.e. [[1 1000 2000] [20 10001 5000] [55 10002 222222]] Find a minimum range contain a number from each row. For above array it should be (1000-1002) range.   

Check if two strings (including caps, whitespace, punctuation) are palindromes without doing any preprocessing. I wrote my code in Java.   

public TrieNode{
	char c;
	TrieNode[] children;
	boolean isWord;

	public TrieNode(char c){
		this.c=c;
		children = new TrieNode[26];
	}

	public void add(String s){
		int charPosition = s.charAt(0)-'a';
		if(children[charPosition]==null){
			TrieNode child = new TrieNode(s.charAt(0));
			children[charPosition] = child;
		}
		if(s.length()>1){
			children[charPosition].add(s.substring(1));
		}else{
			children[charPosition].isWord=true;			
		}
	}
}
